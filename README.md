Day 16 of Spring Boot: Diving Deeper into Spring MVC! <br>

Today’s Spring Boot journey was all about Spring MVC and building web forms! Here’s what I learned: <br>

1) Spring MVC Behind the Scenes: Understood how requests are handled and processed. <br>
2) Hello World Form: Created a simple form and used the `Model` to pass data to the view. <br>
3) Adding Data to Model: Dynamically added data to the model for rendering. <br>
4) Binding Request Params: Captured user input using `@RequestParam`. <br>
5) GetMapping & PostMapping: Handled GET and POST requests seamlessly.
